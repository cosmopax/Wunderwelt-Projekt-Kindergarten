# Wunderwelt: Projekt Kindergarten 🌍🌻
*The Blueprint for Urban Autarky & Radical Resilience*

> "The world is our garden. We are the gardeners."

## Overview
**Wunderwelt** is an open-source framework for transforming existing urban neighborhoods into resilient, self-sufficient **150-person nodes**. It combines sociology (Dunbar's Number), architecture (Biophilia), and governance (Liquid Democracy) into a deployable "Operating System" for the city.

# AGENT BRIEFING: Wunderwelt - Projekt Kindergarten

**Mission:** Construct a digital manifestation of an "Urban Paradise" — a blueprint for redesigning urban existence through the lens of advanced social science, biology, and architecture.

**Core Vision:** "Projekt: Kindergarten" is not a childcare facility. It is a metaphorical playground for the future of humanity. It represents a shift from unexpected dependency to empowered autarky, from isolation to radical cooperation.

## 🧠 Scientific Grounding (Actionable)
Agents must translate complex theories into direct, actionable site content:

*   **Social Architecture (Sociology/Urbanism):** Implement concepts like *Dunbar's Number* in housing design (limiting nodes to ~150 active peers) and *Defensible Space* theory for community safety.
*   **Cognitive Urbanism (Psychology):** Use *Biophilic Design* principles to lower cortisol and increase cognitive function.
*   **Political Economy (PolSci/Anthro):** Propose *Gift Economy* protocols and *Liquid Democracy* tools for local resource management.
*   **Resilient Systems (Cybernetics/Biology):** Design for *Autarky*—local energy production, vertical farming, and closed-loop waste systems.

## 🎨 Aesthetic Directive
*   **Style:** Solarpunk High-Tech. Lush greenery meets sleek glass and sustainable tech.
*   **Vibe:** Optimistic, breathable, golden-hour lighting. "Premium Utopia".
*   **UI:** Glassmorphism, large typography, immersive imagery.

## 🛠️ Operational Roadmap for Swarm
1.  **Content Injection:** Browse specific literature (ArXiv/JSTOR via `paper-fetch`) on "Urban Autarky" and "Social Resilience". Summarize into "Action Modules" for the site.
2.  **Asset Generation:** Create visuals that depict "High-Tech Community Gardens" and "Shared Fabrication Labs".
3.  **Code Expansion:** Build interactive calculators (e.g., "Autarky Score Calculator" or "Community Resource Map").

## 📁 Repository Context
*   **Root:** `/Users/cosmopax/Desktop/projx/academic_webpages/_workspace_antigravity_homepages/Wunderwelt-Projekt-Kindergarten`
*   **Tech Stack:** HTML5, CSS3 (Variables + Flex/Grid), Vanilla JS. *No heavy frameworks.*
*   **Key Files:** `index.html`, `css/style.css`, `AGENT_BRIEFING.md`.

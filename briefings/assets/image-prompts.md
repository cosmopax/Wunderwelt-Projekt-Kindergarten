# Visual Asset Briefing: Wunderwelt Project
*Style Guide: Premium Solarpunk, Architectural Realism, Cinematic Lighting, 8k Resolution*

## 1. Hero Image (Home)
**Prompt:**
`Cinematic wide shot of a transformed urban street in Vienna or Berlin. Solarpunk aesthetic but grounded in reality. The street has no cars; instead, it is a lush green corridor with permeable paving and moss. Buildings are existing 19th-century architecture but retrofitted with "Bio-Thermal Facades" (cables with climbing hops and wisteria). Warm golden hour sunlight filtering through the leaves (dappled light). People of diverse ages sitting on "Social Benches" at intersections. A subtle futuristic "Fab Lab" glass cube is visible on a corner. High detail, photorealistic, architectural rendering style.`

## 2. Module Alpha: Bio-Thermal Facade
**Prompt:**
`Architectural close-up of a "Bio-Thermal Facade". A concrete apartment wall covered in a structured, cable-guided vertical garden. The plants are Hops and Beans, lush and green. A cross-section view shows the air gap between the plants and the wall, illustrating the cooling effect. Rainwater harvesting pipes (copper or clear recycled plastic) are visible feeding the planters. Style: Technical illustration meets National Geographic photography.`

## 3. Module Beta: Fungal Digester
**Prompt:**
`A "Lignin-Fungal Digester" unit in a community courtyard. It consists of stacked, translucent HDPE buckets glowing slightly from internal mycelium activity. The buckets are arranged artistically, not like trash. Oyster mushrooms are fruiting from the sides. A child and an elder are harvesting them together. Soft, earthy tones, morning light. Focus on the texture of the mycelium and the clean design of the reuse system.`

## 4. Module Gamma: Social Bench / Optic Stewardship
**Prompt:**
`Night shot of a "Social Node" intersection. Warm, 2700K amber lighting illuminates a beautifully designed wooden bench where neighbors are talking. The lighting is focused on faces, not the ground. The background shows "permeable boundaries"—waist-high fences that allow sightlines from the homes to the street. The atmosphere is cozy, safe, and inviting. "Defensible Space" theory visualized.`

## 5. Governance Dashboard (UI Concept)
**Prompt:**
`UI design of a mobile "Liquid Democracy" dashboard. Dark mode, glassmorphism style. The screen shows a "Flow Visualization" of votes moving from the user to a delegate named "Maria". Color palette: Deep charcoal background, glowing cyan and gold accents. Clean typography. Elements include a "Reputation Wallet" and "Active Proposals". Futuristic but usable.`

## 6. Biophilic Patterns (Blog)
**Prompt:**
`Abstract architectural concept art demonstrating "Fractal Facades". A building surface that mimics the self-similar geometry of a fern or a coastline. Complex, intricate textures that are pleasing to the eye. Natural materials: stone, wood, and living matter blending seamlessly. The image should evoke a sense of calm and fascination.`

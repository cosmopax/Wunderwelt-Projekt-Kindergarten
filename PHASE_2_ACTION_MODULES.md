# PHASE 2: TACTICAL ACTION MODULES
*Wunderwelt: Projekt Kindergarten - Urban Autarky Blueprint*

## Executive Summary
To bridge the gap between high-level theory ("Urban Autarky") and daily reality, we are launching three new **Action Modules**. These are low-tech, high-impact interventions designed to be deployable by a 150-person node within 30 days using locally sourced materials.

## 🌿 Module Alpha: Bio-Thermal Facade Armor
**Objective:** Passive Climate Control & Psychological Restoration.
**The Problem:** Urban Heat Island effect and energy-intensive active cooling (AC).
**The Solution:** A "Third Skin" for our buildings. Simple, cable-guided vertical greening systems using rapid-growth biomass (e.g., Hops, Wisteria, or Beans for food+shade).
**Key Components:**
*   **Hardware:** Reclaimed steel cables or heavy-duty hemp rope.
*   **Biology:** Deciduous climbers (shade in summer, sun in winter).
*   **Hydrology:** Gravity-fed drip irrigation from rooftop rain barrels.
**Impact:**
*   Reduces indoor temperature by up to 5°C.
*   Biophilic stress reduction (cortisol lowering).
*   Air particulate filtration.

## 🍄 Module Beta: Lignin-Fungal Digesters
**Objective:** Hyper-Local Waste-to-Resource Cycling.
**The Problem:** "Waste" is a design flaw. Nutrient-rich biomass (cardboard, woody trim, coffee) is currently trucked away.
**The Solution:** Distributed myco-cycling stations. Low-tech anaerobic and aerobic fungal digestors that turn cellulose into high-grade soil for the vertical farms.
**Key Components:**
*   **Hardware:** Stacked HDPE buckets or localized wooden pallet bins.
*   **Biology:** Oyster Mushroom (*Pleurotus ostreatus*) spawn for aggressive decomposition.
*   **Output:** Protein (edible mushrooms) + Soil Amendment (spent substrate).
**Impact:**
*   Reduces waste volume by ~60%.
*   Generates high-quality topsoil (crucial for autarky).
*   Educational observation of life cycles.

## 👁️ Module Gamma: Passive Optic Stewardship
**Objective:** Analog Security & Social Cohesion.
**The Problem:** Reliance on electronic surveillance (cameras) breeds distrust and fragility.
**The Solution:** "Soft-Eyes" design interventions. Retrofitting sightlines to maximize **Natural Surveillance** (Defensible Space Theory). We replace cameras with engaged neighbors.
**Key Components:**
*   **Design:** Removal of sight-blocking hedges/fences (replaced with transparent boundaries).
*   **Infrastructure:** "Social Benches" positioned at intersection nodes to encourage loitering-with-intent.
*   **Lighting:** Warm-spectrum, motion-triggered analog lighting that highlights faces, not just spaces.
**Impact:**
*   Increases actual safety via "Eyes on the Street."
*   Strengthens social bonds (the Dunbar Node).
*   Zero digital privacy intrusion.

## Implementation Strategy
1.  **Docs:** Each module will receive a dedicated `HTML` guide in the `/modules/` directory (to be created).
2.  **Tools:** We will add a "Module Cost Calculator" to the existing `index.html` logic.
3.  **Narrative:** These modules will be woven into the "Case Studies" section as "Future Pilots".

- **Functionality**: 
  - Drag-and-drop vote delegation playground.
  - Real-time Gini Coefficient (inequality) and Oligarchy Risk tracking.
  - Hard-coded "Protocol Caps" (10 VP) to prevent power centralization.

### 3. Action Module Protocols (The Playbook)
1. **🌿 Bio-Thermal Armor**: Retrofit guide for metabolic building skins.
2. **🍄 Fungal Digesters**: Mycoremediation protocols for urban waste loops.
3. **👁️ Optic Stewardship**: Newman/Jacobs-based natural surveillance design.
4. **🗳️ Liquid Governance**: Digital trust-network simulation.
5. **🔥 Resilience Rituals**: Social mycelium building (Skill shares, Repair festivals).
6. **🐟 Aquaponics Loop**: High-density protein/water sovereignty.

   - Threshold-based logic
   - Prioritizes lowest-scoring metrics
   - Actionable, science-backed suggestions

3. **Cooperation Multiplier**
   - Community index acts as force multiplier (up to 20% bonus)
   - Reflects scientific principle that social capital enhances physical infrastructure

4. **Zero-Dependency Architecture**
   - Pure vanilla JavaScript
   - No jQuery, React, or frameworks
   - Fast load times, minimal footprint

## 📝 Closing Notes

This implementation successfully transforms the static Wunderwelt website into an interactive tool for exploring urban autarky and community resilience. The features are grounded in real scientific principles (Dunbar's Number, biophilic design, systems theory) while maintaining the Solarpunk aesthetic mandated by the briefing.

**Next Steps**: 
- User testing for UX refinement
- Content expansion (literature summaries)
- Additional interactive modules (Gift Economy simulator, etc.)

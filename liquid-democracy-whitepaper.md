# WUNDERWELT PROTOCOL: LIQUID DEMOCRACY & THE GIFT ECONOMY
*A Governance Operating System for the 150-Person Node*

## 1. The Core Philosophy
Traditional democracy is "transactional": one person, one vote, every 4 years. It assumes every citizen is an expert on everything, or that they must pick a permanent representative who is.

**Liquid Democracy** is "relational": it acknowledges that trust is fluid and expertise is distributed.
**The Gift Economy** is "generative": it acknowledges that social capital (trust) grows when used, unlike fiat currency which is depleted.

## 2. The Mechanism: Fluid Delegation
In a Wunderwelt Node (150 people), we use a **Topic-Based Delegation System**.

### The Three Tiers of Voting
1.  **Direct Vote:** You vote on the issue yourself. (e.g., "Should we build the new rain catchment?")
2.  **Delegated Vote:** You trust someone else on this *topic*. (e.g., "I trust Maria with all WATER decisions. My vote flows to her automatically.")
3.  **Transitive Delegation:** If Maria trusts David on Water, your vote flows through Maria to David.

**Constraint:** Delegation chains are capped at 3 hops to prevent centralization.
**Revocability:** You can take back your delegation at any second. Instant accountability.

## 3. The Gift of Knowledge (The "Currency")
We do not use coin for internal governance. We use **Reputation Credits** generated by "Gifting."

*   **Action:** You teach a workshop on hydroponics.
*   **Verification:** 5 attendees confirm they learned a skill.
*   **Reward:** You gain "Weight" in the Education governance topic.

This aligns *influence* with *proven contribution*. You cannot buy power; you must earn it through service.

## 4. The Tech Stack (Hybrid Analog/Digital)
To remain resilient (autarkic), the system must work without the internet.

*   **Digital:** A local-first mesh app (P2P) running on node members' phones. Syncs via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Direct.
*   **Analog Fallback:** The "Ledger of Trust"—a physical public board where delegations are visualized using colored pins and string (Concept: "String Theory Governance").

## 5. Implementation Steps (Phase 3)
1.  **The Registry:** A cryptographically secure roster of the 150 node members.
2.  **The Topic Tree:** Defining the domains (Water, Energy, Waste, Social).
3.  **The Interface:** A mobile-first dashboard for visualizing vote flows.
